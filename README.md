# StockWatchBot

A small program that I worked on for a few weeks in Spring/Summer of 2020 but ended up ditching for better ideas.  It started as a machine learning idea using the free Alpha Vantage stock API to predict stock prices, but ended up morphing in to just being used for analysis and statistics such as average open price change for SPY by day of the week.

I also added functionality with PubNub to send notifications from a main server to a computer running the notification receiver program.  The idea for this was to send alerts at certain stock prices, as well as alerts when certain patters were forming.
